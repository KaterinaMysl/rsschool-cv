About Me

I am 26 years old. I want to change my job to a Frontend Developer. I study the relevant literature, take courses, master new technologies, improve the level of English. I believe that if you are in love with your work, your goal is achieved with great success. Engineering education and BIM technology help in better understanding of the logic and process of creating code. Drawing and photography skills allow me to better understand the aesthetic component of the desired profession, to achieve contact with the user, harmoniously applying the existing experience with color, proportions and other tools. My path is based on the principle: the accumulation of new knowledge to the existing experience will help me in the desired profession.
